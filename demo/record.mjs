/**
 * Records the end-to-end demo.
 *
 * Two segments, recorded as two Playwright contexts and joined afterwards:
 *
 *   1. "Two clients, one writer" — the reference viewer and the iPhone client
 *      side by side while the scenario plays. Captions name the chapter; the
 *      phone is switched to whichever surface that chapter is about.
 *   2. "The hub dashboard" — a tour of the Drive surfaces in the Cline hub.
 *
 * Nothing is scripted into the UIs. The recorder only makes MCP calls and
 * presses real controls; every value that appears is the clients folding the
 * writer's log.
 *
 * The scenario is a parameter, not a hardcoded import — `demo.mjs record
 * --scenario ./my-story.mjs` films a different story with the same rig. See
 * "Writing a new demo" in the README for the module contract.
